# Project-Human Activity Recognition
ABSTRACT:-
	        This paper proposes a real-time human action recognition approach to static video surveillance systems. This approach predicts human actions using temporal images and convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of deep learning model that can automatically learn features from training videos. Although the state-of-the-art methods have shown high accuracy, they consume a lot of computational resources. Another problem is that many methods assume that exact knowledge of human positions. Moreover, most of the current methods build complex handcrafted features for speciﬁc classiﬁers. Therefore, these kinds of methods are difﬁcult to apply in real-world applications. 
          Human activity recognition is a significant component of many innovative and human-behavior based systems. The ability to recognize various human activities enables the developing of intelligent control system. Usually the task of human activity recognition is mapped to the classification task of images representing person’s actions.
          This project proposes a real-time human action recognition approach to static video surveillance systems. This approach predicts human actions using temporal images and convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of deep learning model that can automatically learn features from training videos.
          This project provides the comparison study on these methods applied for human activity recognition task using the set of images representing two categories of daily life activities.
          
          
OBJECTIVE:-
           To recognize the human activities by analyzing the data using classifiers methods.
           
           
DATA DESCRIPTION:-
           We collect the data through camera and have a video from recordings of the two activities Sitting & Running.
           All data in the form of videos.
           Parameters such as video, image, shape, size, activity can be taken in consideration. We define parameters ourselves after the data collection as per our requirements.
           From each video we extract, detect & save 70 person images by using Yolo pre-trained model.
